CPSC 350-01
Assignment 1: C++ Review

Source files:
    1. main.cpp
    2. FileManager.h
    3. FileManager.cpp
    4. DataManager.h
    5. DataManager.cpp

Compile/run commands:
    - make all
    - ./assignment1.exe <filename>

Errors:
    No known compiler or runtime errors, however in some cases with extreme variance, the Gaussian Distribution function would return a negative integer. I was unable to figure out what was wrong, so I put an abs() around the return integer to prevent any possible runtime errors.
